ROT47 is a derivative of ROT13 which, in addition to scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A-Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, all 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~' are rotated by 47 positions, without special preserving of case. 
The use of a larger alphabet is intended to produce a more thorough 
obfuscation than that of ROT13, but because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it's much more obvious that the text has been enciphered.
